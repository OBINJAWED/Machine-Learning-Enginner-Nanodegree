## Projects:

### Project 1: 

#### Predicting Boston Housing Prices
Created a model based on statistical analysis to estimate the best-selling price for a home in Boston.

### Project 2: 

#### Find Donors for CharityML
Developed an algorithm for a fictitious charity organization to best identify potential donors to reduce overhead costs of sending mail.

### Project 3: 

#### Creating Customer Segments
Applied unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data which was collected from customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data.

### Project 4: 

#### Dog Breed Classifier
Built a pipeline to process user-supplied images.
The algorithm identifies an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If given an image of a human, the code will identify the dog that it most resembles.

### Project 5: 

#### Train a QuadCoptor to Fly
Designed an agent to fly a quadcopter, and then trained it using a reinforcement learning algorithm.

### Project 6: 

#### Predicting Wine Quality
Built a model to predict wine quality based on attributes like acidity, pH, and chlorides.
